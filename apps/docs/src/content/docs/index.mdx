## Quick Example

Create a page with data loading in seconds:

```tsx
// app/users/[id]/page.tsx
import type { PageProps, LoaderArgs } from '@cloudwerk/core';

export async function loader({ params, context }: LoaderArgs) {
  const user = await context.db
    .selectFrom('users')
    .where('id', '=', params.id)
    .executeTakeFirst();

  if (!user) throw new NotFoundError();
  return { user };
}

export default function UserPage({ user }: PageProps & { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
